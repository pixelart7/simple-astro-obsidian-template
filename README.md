# (Dead) Simple Astro Obsidian Template

A proof-of-concept repository that makes [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notes work with [Astro](https://astro.build/). I pulled some of my codes that I used in my [website](https://chaiyapat.pix7.me/garden) and put it in `garden.ts`. This is by no means ready for production. It will not be easy to setup, it is just a proof-of-concept.

I decided to make a separate repository to put the `garden.ts` file somewhere for anyone interested in making backlinks and outgoing links in their Astro setup.

Content in `/content` are from [PARA Starter Kit by cotemaxime](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/para-starter-kit/223), I didn't modify anything and it is here just for me to test the features.

I've deploy this site on Netlify (see: https://regal-monstera-caceee.netlify.app/) to show what it can do (dark mode, linking wikilinks, backlinks, outgoing links, sidebar file browser, ...) and what it can't do (tags, frontmatter in table, ...). It is deploy in around 35 seconds thanks to Yarn 3. Feel free to adapt it to your own projects :>
