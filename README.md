# (Dead) Simple Astro Obsidian Template

A proof-of-concept repository that makes [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notes work with [Astro](https://astro.build/). I pulled some of my codes that I used in my [website](https://chaiyapat.pix7.me/garden) and put it in `garden.ts`. This is by no means ready for production. It will not be easy to setup, it is just a proof-of-concept.

I decided to make a separate repository to put the `garden.ts` file somewhere for anyone interested in making backlinks and outgoing links in their Astro setup.

Content in `/content` are from [PARA Starter Kit by cotemaxime](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/para-starter-kit/223), I didn't modify anything and it is here just for me to test the features.
